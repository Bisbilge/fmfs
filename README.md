# 🏴 FMFS – Free Market, Free Speech

**FMFS** is a multiplayer economic simulation where players explore alternative economic systems, tax models, and public services.

Each player joins or forms a guild (state), produces goods, manages resources, and navigates a world where speaking in chat also has a cost — funded by taxation.

### Core Ideas

- 🏛 Competing state models (socialist, libertarian, etc.)
- 💬 Chat access via tax-funded "chat tokens"
- 📦 Decentralized production, trade, and storage
- 💰 Fixed-supply currency + optional guild coins

Built to test what kind of systems people actually choose — when they are free to choose.

> In markets and speech alike: freedom reveals truth.
